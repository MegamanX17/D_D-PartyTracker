Project number: NCP - 001 - 2
Project name: "D&D Party Tracker"
Classification: Information

Purpose: This windows forms application is meant to be used to take notes in regards to the tabletop board game D&D. 
Due to the nature of D&D games, there is a lot to remember and notice on everyone's part. 
This program will make sessions more enjoyable by being able to provide everyone with an 
organized assessment of a player's current health points (hp) and what is available to be 
accessed by the entire party (for instance if a key recently discovered by one of the members 
could be used by all members at any point in time). Future versions of this program will be developed 
in a "C sharp" environment, and will eventually be able to save a comprehensible file version of its 
notes as well as load files containing previous notes. This version of the "D&D Party Tracker" is
a refinement of previous versions (NCP - 001) and is intended to be a dymanically changing application.

Current Goals:
-Create a windows form that will show and handle all D&D notes. (Not Completed)
-The application will only use a single form/window. (So far so good) [This goal has been abandoned and the application will close down current forms/windows and use new ones]
-Create "C sharp" code that is able to create a file containing the program's D&D notes. (Not Completed)

Log:

1/20/2023
-Development of the dymanically changing "D&D Party Tracker" has begun.
-Party Tracker is able to save the current number of players.
-The program is able to clear the current window form after clicking on the "Enter" button.
-Party Tracker is able to be closed down by clicking on the "Close" button.

1/27/2023
-After clicking on "Enter" the current program is able to create a new empty text box.
-(Bug) The program is able to create both an empty text box and a label, these elements 
sometimes overlap each other.

1/29/2023
-(Bug fix) The program is able to correctly create both an empty text box and a label without
either elements overlapping each other.
-The second part of this program is now able to dynamically create a prompt to accept each player's name.
-The program is now able to create a button that will "lock" an entered name to avoid that
name being changed on accident.
-(Bug) The dynamically created "Lock" buttons are unable to lock their respective text boxes.
-(Developer's note) I need to figure out a way to save each player's name as they're entered.

7/8/2023
-The Development of the "D&D Party Tracker" will be continued as of 3:04 AM 7/8/2023.
-(Developer's note) Due to recent developments in my personal life, and technical complications encountered by this project, the progress of this project had been halted.
-(Developer's note) The decision has been made to simplify this project by removing its ability to delete, create, and manipulate current windows elements.
-Documentation and development of this project will be switched over to GitHub.
